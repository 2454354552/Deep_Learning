This is my deep learning repository 

As we all know, MNIST data set is a common image data set for machine learning. Whenever we just learn a new classification algorithm, it is very appropriate to use MNIST data set to verify our new algorithm.

In this repository, I will use MNIST datasets to verify the deep learning algorithms I have learned, including but not limited to MLP, CNN, GAN, VAE and ViT.
